# GeoAlarm
Project for the exam at the end of high school

Overall description: 
The project is designed to help travellers: since trains and buses are not always on time (sometimes they arrive earlier, sometimes they are late), poeple travelling during the night may not know when to wake up in order to get off the train/bus at the right station. 
Using this app they can set an alarm, that gets activated based on their GPS coordinates: when they get in the previously precised geographycal area, the alarm will wake them up.
